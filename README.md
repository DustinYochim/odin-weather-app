## Features

- Search for weather information by location.
- Toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature units.
- Dynamic background and imagery based on weather conditions.
- Loading component while waiting for API response.

2. Enter the location for which you want to check the weather.
3. Click the "Search" button.
4. The weather information will be displayed, along with background images that correspond to the weather conditions.

## API Key Security

In this project, the API key is exposed in the client-side code for demonstration purposes. However, in a real-world application, it's important to follow best practices for API key security. To enhance security:

Store API keys on the server-side using environment variables.
Avoid sending API keys directly to the frontend.
Implement server-side authentication and authorization to control API access.
